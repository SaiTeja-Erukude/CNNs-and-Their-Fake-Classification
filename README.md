# Unveiling-CNNs-Behavior

- Developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including VGG16 and ResNet50 from scratch.
- Training the CNNs on datasets comprising of Imagenette and COVID-19 image data.
- Applying Fourier and Wavelet transforms on images, retraining the models, and evaluating their efficacy.
